# Final Project Technigo Bootcamp
# BookStore


## Idea  
I created an online bookstore named 'Sweden Tech Library'. The users have the possibility to find books related to technology like programming languages, databases, code, and more. The user also has the chance to search for a specific title, author, or category, and see more details for every book. 
They have their own session using singup/in and with that session activated they can see the profile page, make a wishlist, add books to a cart, and finally buy books. 
This is the final project of [Technigo Bootcamp to become a Web Developer](https://www.technigo.io/program). 
I decided to work with the frontend and [backend](https://github.com/PriscilaAlfaro/bookstore-backend) in separated repositories for the project.

## General design ideas
Even though I'm not a designer, I developed a general idea about how I wanted the page to look and also a general description of my data modeling  in a simple [jamboard document](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1P-4nCIT4J0eBcKg9AAa4y0nALJxTdqozpYkcxH2C2EM/viewer?f=5)
